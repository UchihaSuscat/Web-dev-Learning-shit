Hi I am Angad.
This is my journey of Learning Web Dev.

I am in 10th Rightnow. (Its 29-02-2024 Yes Doing this while giving boards doesn't matter)

This is basically some sort of Dev log like ahh log of me learning web dev.

I am on my Mom's laptop rn

On 20 march I will get my pc back and also I will be shifting from windows to Arch cuz linux 100%
better tbh hehe

Finished building my portfolio website (from a tutorial i saw and learned some css and html stuff) -29-02-2024

If i had to take a guess I will prob get done learning the front end of web dev by august-september hmm we will see....
